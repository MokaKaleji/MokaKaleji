## About Me
I am a **graduate in Economics and Econometrics** from the University of Bologna, specializing in **high-dimensional and time-varying dynamic factor models**.  
My research focuses on advancing econometric inference under structural change and uncertainty, with applications to **macroeconomic forecasting** and **monetary policy analysis**.  

My master’s thesis, *“Time-Varying Dynamic Factor Models: Estimation and Forecasting,”* developed a **kernel-based EM–QML estimation framework** for factor models with smoothly evolving parameters.
